# Color Screen for Raycast

> Launch a distraction-free full-screen solid or gradient color overlay directly from Raycast.

Color Screen is a productivity-friendly color picker for macOS users who prefer keyboard-first flows. Instantly cover your display with a brand color, a calming gradient, or any ad-hoc HEX you type—perfect for focus rituals, design reviews, screen demos, and content creation.

## Why designers & creators love it

- **Instant overlays** – Press a Raycast hotkey, search for a preset, and your entire display is filled with that color in under a second.
- **Solid + gradient library** – Curated swatches (black, mint, sunset gradients, etc.) with fuzzy search and keyword support.
- **Custom palettes** – Save named HEX combinations, favorite them, edit later, and keep everything synced via Raycast LocalStorage.
- **Recent history** – Jump back to the last colors you showcased without retyping anything.
- **Swift-powered fullscreen renderer** – Uses a lightweight Swift script to open a true system-level borderless window so there are zero menu bars or distractions.

## Getting started

1. Install [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) on macOS.
2. Open the Raycast Store, search for **Color Screen**, and add it to your extensions.
3. Assign a keyboard shortcut if you want instant access.
4. (Optional) Install Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`) the first time Raycast asks for Swift runtime access.

## How to use it

1. **Launch the command** – Open Raycast and run **Color Screen** (or use your assigned hotkey).
2. **Search or type** – Enter color names ("mint", "sunset"), HEX values (`#ff4757`), or gradients (`#ff4757,#1e90ff`).
3. **Preview instantly** – The top result lets you show the entered color or gradient in full screen right away.
4. **Browse sections** – Scroll for Recently Used, Custom Colors, Popular Solids, and Gradients.
5. **Favorite + edit** – Star the colors you use often, rename them, or adjust HEX values whenever inspiration strikes.

## Requirements

- macOS with Raycast installed
- Swift runtime (Xcode Command Line Tools or Xcode) for the fullscreen renderer (prompted automatically)

## Privacy & permissions

The extension stores your custom colors, favorites, and recents locally via `LocalStorage`. No network requests or analytics are performed.
